# Python-Project-6
Project: - Credit Card Faurad Detection.
I am done this project at CodSoft as an Intern.

In this project, I am constructing a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The tasks involve preprocessing and normalizing the transaction data, addressing class imbalance issues, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. The classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, is then trained to classify transactions as either fraudulent or genuine.
